## In-Depth
If you have some knowledge about IT, you'll notice that I use a system based on [Linux](https://kernel.org/), but if that name doesn't mean anything to you, I recommend you take a look at [this page](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/).

It has been since January 2023 that I almost exclusively use Linux on my computer, and I can't remember the last time I booted my dual-boot of Windows so I consider that I've completely switched to it.

Before having Linux as a daily-driver on my system, I, like many, used Windows, and I can't say that I've had a bad experience with it.
