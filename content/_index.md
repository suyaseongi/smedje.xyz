# Hi
Welcome to my first website project !

I'll be posting various info about my [hobbies](/hobbies), my ["daily driving" system](/forge) and details about this website.

By the way, if you're wondering about the style of the website : Yes ! The old-school look is intentional, as I prefer an uncluttered appearance.

See you soon!
