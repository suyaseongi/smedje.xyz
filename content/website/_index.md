This website is powered by :
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a framework for building static websites at a blazing-fast speed, using content written in the simple [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format

- [risotto](https://github.com/joeroe/risotto), the base theme that was used, albeit slightly modified to suit me
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), for hosting, although I'm considering switching to a basic server to expand my knowledge and to host other services on it
