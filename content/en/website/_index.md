## Tools
This website is powered by :
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a framework for building static websites at a blazing-fast speed, using content written in the simple [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), for hosting, although I'm considering switching to a basic server to expand my knowledge and to host other services on it

## Libraries
- [risotto](https://github.com/joeroe/risotto), the base theme that was used, albeit slightly modified to suit me, initially released under [MIT License](https://github.com/suyaseongi/suyaseongi.github.io/blob/main/themes/risotto/LICENSE)
