## Hobbies
Currently, my main hobbies are the following :

[Audio](./audio) hardware, studying [cybersecurity](./cybersecurity), learning [languages](./languages) and listening/playing [music](./music).

## Why ?
As time passed, I came to realize that curiosity was one of my main personality traits.

I couldn't pause for a moment without learning something new here and there.

I always found it very important to never stop discovering new topics, with the goal of diversifying my field of knowledge.

Inevitably, because of that, I think that I'm not able to master a skill before moving on to seek freshness and switching over.

Despite it all, I find this situation acceptable because it gives me a strong foundation of knowledge across a wide range of subjects, and I get to pursue learning at any time.
