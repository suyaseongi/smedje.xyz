On this page, I'm establishing a scale to determine the factors that makes me like a certain work of musical art, mostly albums, so to attempt to theorize something that's very abstract to me.

Let's first create a tree structure defining the different factors that matter to me.

- Technical
    - Composition
        - Rhythm
            - Unusual time signature
            - Tempo change
        - Melody
            - No extremely standard chord progressions
        - No fade-out
    - Recording
    - Mixing / Mastering
