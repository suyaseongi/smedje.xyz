Alright, so this is the place where I'll write about music, and more specifically my relation to music.

I also plan to use this section as a way to understand better the kinds of music that I tend to like, since I always find it hard to define that.

Without further ado, let's start with the obvious : the genres

When I get asked what genre of music I listen to, I systematically have a moment of lag where I'm not sure of how I should summarize my tastes in a few defined categories. It reminds me of a friend that often tells me : `"Le concept de genre c'est vraiment de la m*rde"` / `"The concept of music genre is really sh*tty"`, suggesting that music shouldn't be categorized, but rather that every work should be recognized as a singular element in itself, or at least linked to other works that have inspired it. Of course he balances that by saying that it is a necessary evil, because it allows for easier discovery of new works with common features.

Needless to say, there are genres that I tend to listen more than others, but as one genre encapsulates a broad selection of works, it's hard for me to say that I "like" a certain genre, because it would mean that I would supposedly like any work of the genre, which is obviously not the case.

Enough of theory ! According to my listening stats, the genres that I listen the most are `Metal` and `K-POP`. You read that right. I know it's a rather silly combination but that's how things are. I hope that after reading that, you understand the challenge that is to define 'music that I listen to'.
