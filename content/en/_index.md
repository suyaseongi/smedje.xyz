# Hi
Welcome to my first website project !

My name is Seiji (aka smedje), and I'm currently a highschooler in France. 

I'll be posting various info about my [hobbies](/hobbies), my "daily driving" [system](/forge) and details about this [website](/website).

By the way, if you're wondering about the style of the website : Yes ! The old-school look is intentional, as I prefer an uncluttered appearance.

See you soon!
